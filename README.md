 Base classes and scripts for HyperGnosys modules

 ScripableProperties are useful in order to have multiple objects that share one same variable. For example, 5 types of enemies that all move at 5 speed.
 They can also be used to maintain the state of an object, like the player, through scenes. This is because ScriptableObjects don't get reset when you change scenes.
